# Introduction

Welcome to the Etro documentation! Here, you'll find everything you need to get started with Etro.

## What is Etro?

Etro is a TypeScript library for creating videos in the browser. It uses a list of layers and a list of effects to render the video to a `<canvas>` element and an [audio context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext). You can also record the movie to a [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob).
