# Introduction

Etro is a frontend video-processing framework. You can composite, concatenate, filter, crop and trim image, audio, video and text content. The result can be rendered to a `<canvas>` element and an [audio context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext), streamed with WebRTC or recorded to a [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob). You can create custom sources and filters to fit your use case.

Etro can be used with React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, and plain JavaScript.
